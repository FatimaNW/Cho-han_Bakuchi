# 🎲 Chō-Han Bakuchi

A simple terminal-based version of the traditional Japanese dice game **Chō-Han Bakuchi**, implemented in Python.

## 📖 About the Game

**Chō-Han Bakuchi** is an old game that involves guessing whether the sum of two dice is even (**Chō**) or odd (**Han**). In this digital version, you wager virtual cash and try your luck!

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. You start with a set amount of virtual cash.
2. For each round:
   - Place a wager.
   - Guess either **Chō (Even)** or **Han (Odd)**.
   - The computer rolls two dice and calculates their sum.
   - If your guess is correct, you win the wager amount. Otherwise, you lose it.
3. You can keep playing until you run out of money or choose to quit.

## 💡 Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Fully random dice rolls using Python's `random` module
